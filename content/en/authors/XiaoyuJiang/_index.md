I received my Ph.D. in Control Science and Engineering from Zhejiang University. Prior to my current position, I conducted postdoctoral and visiting research at the State Key Laboratory of Industrial Control Technology at Zhejiang University, the Department of Systems Engineering at City University of Hong Kong, and the Department of Aerospace Engineering at the University of Kansas. My research focuses on industrial big data modeling, deep learning, foundation industrial models, and the security and reliability of AI systems. I have published over 40 papers in top-tier journals such as IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics, IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics, IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering, IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement, IEEE Transactions on Artificial Intelligence, and IEEE/CAA Journal of Automatica Sinica, as well as leading international conferences including NeurIPS.
