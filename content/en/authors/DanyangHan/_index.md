I am currently pursuing a Ph.D. in Measurement Technology and Instruments at Beihang University. 
<!--more-->
My research is dedicated to the industrial manufacturing and aerospace sectors, focusing on health status fusion, performance degradation modeling, remaining useful life (RUL) prediction, and fault diagnosis for complex equipment. This work is grounded in digital twin theory and integrates both physical knowledge and deep learning models. I have participated in several national-level projects, including the National Natural Science Foundation of China and the National Key R&D Program, as well as multiple collaborative projects with industry partners.
