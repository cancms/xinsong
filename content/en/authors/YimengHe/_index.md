I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at the Hangzhou International Innovation Institute, Beihang University.

My research interests lie in causal discovery, data-driven industrial modeling, machine learning, and deep learning. I have published several SCI-indexed journal papers on causality-driven industrial process modeling, with contributions appearing in IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics, IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement, Neurocomputing, and other journals. I also serve as a reviewer for journals including Systems Science & Control Engineering and the International Journal of Systems Science.
